UCB Flor
========

Flor_ (formerly known as Jarvis_) is a system with a declarative DSL embedded in python for managing the workflow development phase of the machine learning lifecycle. Flor enables data scientists to describe ML workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of *Actions* and *Artifacts*, and to experiment with different configurations by automatically running the workflow many times, varying the configuration. To date, Flor serves as a build system for producing some desired artifact, and serves as a versioning system that enables tracking the evolution of artifacts across multiple runs in support of reproducibility.
